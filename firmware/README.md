A fresh stream of serial data is being broadcasted about every 12ms.

The serial stream starts off with | (pipe character), followed by:
```
time_ms, gps_lat , gps_lon , gps_alt , gps_num_sat , acc_x , acc_y , acc_z, giro_x , giro_y , giro_z, magneto_x , magneto_y , magneto_z, delta_t, pressure_alt, pressure_temp
```
Output example:
